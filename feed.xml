                <p>Writing for <em>Byline Times</em>, Olly Haynes has revealed troubling content shared by <strong>Richmond Park</strong> candidate <mark>Michael Hearn</mark>.</p><p>The article reveals that Hearn previously faced calls to resign from the Conservative Party after sharing far-right material. In 2018, as reported by <em>Evolve Politics</em>, Hearn had listed Hajo Hermann as an ‘inspirational person’ on his Facebook account.</p><p>Hajo Hermann was a Nazi lawyer who went on to defend Holocaust deniers (including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajo_Herrmann#Law_career_and_Nazi_activism">David Irving</a>) and neo-Nazis in court late into his life.</p><p>Hearn is also reported to have shared content from neo-fascist group Generation Identity, and Britain First.</p><p>Calling for people to vote for Reform on Facebook recently, Hearn is reported to have written “as an Englishman we have seen our entire country changed without our consent without thought without consideration to our tribes within the kingdom our heritage and culture”, and “rapists murderers terrorists and tomorrow’s groomers of our children can just walk in”.</p><p>Hearn appears to have at least two Twitter/X identities (@StormHearn and @HearnStorm), both of which combine parts of his full name, and are linked by references to the East India Company logo, references to Stevenage, and being a paramedic. Both of these accounts have posted racist content. For example, in a reply to a post referring to London Mayor Sadiq Khan walking his dog, @HearnStorm posted</p><blockquote>
<p>Has he strapped small explosive vests to them yet like his friends in Hamas do.</p></blockquote>

                <p>The <em>Derby Telegraph</em> reports that <strong>Derbyshire Dales</strong> candidate <mark>Edward Oakenfull</mark> claimed the UK’s IQ was being “diluted” and put in “severe decline” due to immigration. The comments, which Oakenfull would later claim were taken out of context, were madeon Twitter/X in June 2023, after losing an election for a borough council seat in May:</p><blockquote>
<p>The gene pool decline is another interesting area. By importing loads of sub Saharan Africans plus Muslims that inter breed the IQ is in severe decline.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other comments include allegations that “nothing good will come out of importing yet more Muslims”. He added, “You think the pro Palestine/ Hamas marches over the past few weeks are disturbing, you ain’t seen nothing yet!”</p><p>Oakenfull also said in November: “There are loads of different minority groups within the police, Black Police Officers Association, Muslim, even Turkish, what the hell happened to the police? They succumbed to woke and are now just not fit for purpose.” In December he said: “The newly appointed Chair of the BBC is a Muslim, another reason to cancel the license (<em>sic</em>) as you just know more woke drivel will be churned out!”</p><p>Approached for comment, Oakenfull said: </p><blockquote>
<p>With regards to the comments made by myself on twitter, the majority are taken out of context for example the comments regarding importing sub Saharan Africans and diluting the gene pool, this was part of a conversation regarding a book called the Bell Curve which relates to IQ levels in different countries around the world. I was discussing the content of the book.  </p><p>With regards to the tweet about our police force. I welcome diversity within the police force but I don’t agree with all the groups within the police force. It should be one police force not segregating different races within it. And in my opinion the police have become too soft and there is more emphasis on hate crime rather than real crime.  </p><p>With regards to my tweet made on 10/11/23. Migration is off the scale and some Muslims who come to this country do not wish to integrate and we are seeing evidence of this with Sectarian Politics. With regards to my tweet made on 13/12/23. If the newly appointed Chair of the BBC is the best person for the job then brilliant.  </p><p>However, we are increasingly seeing a tick box culture within our society of promoting minorities into roles rather than the best person for the job. With regards to my tweet made on 10/2/24. Large scale immigration has resulted in community tensions and lack of integration and an increase in anti semitism.  </p></blockquote>

I’m sure if you look around you’ll find some really nice posts, how I feel about animals, animal welfare, how I feel about the planet. It’s not all bad.”</p><p>Regarding the Enoch Powel and BNP comments, he said “I’ve got no excuses for that. I think they’re a disgusting party. I don’t like the English Defence League.

                <p><em>Ashfield Constituency</em></p><p>Ex-Labour, ex-Conservative Reform candidate for Ashfield has a solution for dealing with asylum seekers that doesn’t involve sending them to Rwanda. According to <mark>Lee Anderson</mark>, speaking to Jo Coburn on the BBC’s Politics Live,</p><blockquote>
<p>… there is another solution to the illegal migrants, and this is going to probably get me into some sort of hot water with you lot in the media.<br>I said this to a previous home secretary, I won’t say which one, but if some of these migrants do land on the beaches, let’s take them to a remote Scottish island somewhere, the Outer Hebrides where nobody lives, give them the building material and let them set their own camps up.<br>I’m sure they’ll be safe and free from persecution in war-torn France.”</p></blockquote>
