<p>Men pay 80% of tax – women spend 80% of tax revenue. On aggregate as a group you only take from society.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just to cap things off, Gribbin also said Winston Churchill was “abysmal” and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>The Reform Party’s initial response to criticisms of the remarks was to defend them, including telling the <em>Jewish Chronicle</em>, “We’re not going to sack him, he’s done nothing wrong.”</p><p>After initially declining to comment, Gribbin did later apologise:</p><blockquote>
<p>I apologise for these old comments and withdraw them unreservedly and the upset that they have caused.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Commenting on his candidate’s remarks, Nigel Farage claimed vetting issues caused by the unexpected election timing.</p><p>Sources:<br><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjmmrwexv4ko">https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjmmrwexv4ko</a><br><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/10/reform-uk-defends-candidate-over-hitler-neutrality-comments">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/10/reform-uk-defends-candidate-over-hitler-neutrality-comments</a><br><a href="https://www.thejc.com/news/politics/reform-uk-candidate-says-britain-should-have-stayed-neutral-in-ww2-rc2yrizd">https://www.thejc.com/news/politics/reform-uk-candidate-says-britain-should-have-stayed-neutral-in-ww2-rc2yrizd</a></p>

<p>… there is another solution to the illegal migrants, and this is going to probably get me into some sort of hot water with you lot in the media.<br>I said this to a previous home secretary, I won’t say which one, but if some of these migrants do land on the beaches, let’s take them to a remote Scottish island somewhere, the Outer Hebrides where nobody lives, give them the building material and let them set their own camps up.<br>I’m sure they’ll be safe and free from persecution in war-torn France.”</p></blockquote>
