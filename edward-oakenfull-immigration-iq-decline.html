The comments, which Oakenfull would later claim were taken out of context, were madeon Twitter/X in June 2023, after losing an election for a borough council seat in May:</p><blockquote><p>The gene pool decline is another interesting area. By importing loads of sub Saharan Africans plus Muslims that inter breed the IQ is in severe decline.</p></blockquote><p>Other comments include allegations that “nothing good will come out of importing yet more Muslims”. He added, “You think the pro Palestine/ Hamas marches over the past few weeks are disturbing, you ain’t seen nothing yet!”</p><p>Oakenfull also said in November: “There are loads of different minority groups within the police, Black Police Officers Association, Muslim, even Turkish, what the hell happened to the police? They succumbed to woke and are now just not fit for purpose.” In December he said: “The newly appointed Chair of the BBC is a Muslim, another reason to cancel the license (<em>sic</em>) as you just know more woke drivel will be churned out!”</p><p>Approached for comment, Oakenfull said:</p><blockquote><p>With regards to the comments made by myself on twitter, the majority are taken out of context for example the comments regarding importing sub Saharan Africans and diluting the gene pool, this was part of a conversation regarding a book called the Bell Curve which relates to IQ levels in different countries around the world. I was discussing the content of the book.</p><p>With regards to the tweet about our police force. I welcome diversity within the police force but I don’t agree with all the groups within the police force. It should be one police force not segregating different races within it. And in my opinion the police have become too soft and there is more emphasis on hate crime rather than real crime.</p><p>With regards to my tweet made on 10/11/23. Migration is off the scale and some Muslims who come to this country do not wish to integrate and we are seeing evidence of this with Sectarian Politics. With regards to my tweet made on 13/12/23. If the newly appointed Chair of the BBC is the best person for the job then brilliant.</p><p>However, we are increasingly seeing a tick box culture within our society of promoting minorities into roles rather than the best person for the job. With regards to my tweet made on 10/2/24. Large scale immigration has resulted in community tensions and lack of integration and an increase in anti semitism.</p></blockquote><hr><p>Source:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/local-news/reform-candidates-resurfaced-tweet-says-9351333">Reform candidate’s resurfaced tweet says ‘UK’s IQ is being diluted’</a></li></ul></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://reformhasthebestpeople.github.io/angela-carter-begbie-king-charles-weak.html" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  Angela Carter-Begbie calls King Charles &#x27;weak&#x27; "><span class="btn__icon">←</span> <span class="btn__text">Angela Carter-Begbie calls King Charles &#x27;weak&#x27;</span> </a><a href="https://reformhasthebestpeople.github.io/mirror-round-up.html" class="btn next" rel="next" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  Mirror round-up of Reform&#x27;s &#x27;weirdest&#x27; candidates "><span class="btn__text">Mirror round-up of Reform&#x27;s &#x27;weirdest&#x27; candidates</span> <span class="btn__icon">→</span></a></div></nav></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2024 Powered by Publii CMS :: <a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theme</a> ported by the <a href="https://getpublii.com/customization-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publii Team</a></p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://reformhasthebestpeople.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=74fad06980c30243d91d72c7c57fcdb8"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
