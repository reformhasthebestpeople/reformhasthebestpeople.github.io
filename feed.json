He wrote “I could weep now, every time I pick up a British newspaper and read the latest about the state of the UK. No doubt, Enoch Powell would be doing the same if he was alive. My solution … vote BNP!”</p><p>The comments were found on an archived version of the website, which has since been changed.</p><p>When approached by <em>The Times</em> about the comments, StClair-Armstrong said: “I don’t have this stuff on my website any more. … I removed all that stuff and made the website respectable. … I cleaned up my act a long long time ago. I’m sure if you look around you’ll find some really nice posts, how I feel about animals, animal welfare, how I feel about the planet. It’s not all bad.”</p><p>Regarding the Enoch Powel and BNP comments, he said “I’ve got no excuses for that. I think they’re a disgusting party. I don’t like the English Defence League. I don’t like them.” He added that he saw no alternative but to stand down as a Reform candidate.</p><p>Sources:<br><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/reform-uk-candidate-resign-bnp-support-q33rphtzt\">https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/reform-uk-candidate-resign-bnp-support-q33rphtzt</a> [<a href=\"https://archive.ph/rb07v%5D\">https://archive.ph/rb07v]</a><br><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/06/17/reform-candidate-resigns-bnp-historic-comments/\">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/06/17/reform-candidate-resigns-bnp-historic-comments/</a> [<a href=\"https://archive.ph/OGVkB%5D\">https://archive.ph/OGVkB]</a></p>",
