Both of these accounts have posted racist content.

By importing loads of sub Saharan Africans plus Muslims that inter breed the IQ is in severe decline.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Other comments include allegations that “nothing good will come out of importing yet more Muslims”. He added, “You think the pro Palestine/ Hamas marches over the past few weeks are disturbing, you ain’t seen nothing yet!”</p><p>Oakenfull also said in November: “There are loads of different minority groups within the police, Black Police Officers Association, Muslim, even Turkish, what the hell happened to the police?

I was discussing the content of the book.  </p><p>With regards to the tweet about our police force. I welcome diversity within the police force but I don’t agree with all the groups within the police force. It should be one police force not segregating different races within it. And in my opinion the police have become too soft and there is more emphasis on hate crime rather than real crime.  </p><p>With regards to my tweet made on 10/11/23. Migration is off the scale and some Muslims who come to this country do not wish to integrate and we are seeing evidence of this with Sectarian Politics. With regards to my tweet made on 13/12/23. If the newly appointed Chair of the BBC is the best person for the job then brilliant.  </p><p>However, we are increasingly seeing a tick box culture within our society of promoting minorities into roles rather than the best person for the job.
